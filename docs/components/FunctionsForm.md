# Component: FunctionsForm

## Purpose

To allow users to define the available functions for the AI assistant.

## States

- `functions`: An array of `ChatFunction` objects that represent the available functions for the AI assistant.

## User Interactions

- Add function: Users can add a new function to the list.
- Edit function: Users can edit an existing function in the list.
- Delete function: Users can delete a function from the list.

## Component Behavior

- Update functions: The component has functions to add, edit, and delete functions in the `functions` state. When a function is added, edited, or deleted, the `onFunctionsChange` function is called with the updated list of functions.

## Props

- `onFunctionsChange`: A function that is called whenever the `functions` state changes. This function takes an array of `ChatFunction` objects as a parameter.

## Dependencies

- [ChatTypes](../types/ChatTypes.md): The FunctionsForm component uses the `ChatFunction` type from `ChatTypes`.
