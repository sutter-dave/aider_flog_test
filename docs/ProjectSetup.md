1. Initialize a new project with npm.
2. Install React and ReactDOM.
3. Install TypeScript and set up a `tsconfig.json` file.
4. Install and configure Webpack as the build tool.
5. Create a basic directory structure:
    - `src`: This is where all the source code will reside.
        - `components`: This is where all the React components will reside.
